Version: 2.2.4
Date: 2024/03/30
  Changes:
    - Fixed an issue where an internal tracking counter could get out of sync with the number of roboports in use.
    - Fixed a rare issue discovered by Dir39 that could cause a non-recoverable error.
  Known Issues:
    - Space Exploration Compatability: When attempting to place space scaffolding, it will error once per tile, but the creep will progress. (Issue #1)
    - Angels Bioprocessing Compatability: Attempting to place Bio Tiles near water will deadlock a ropobort's creep method. (Issue #10)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.2.3
Date: 2024/03/17
  Changes:
    - More tweaks to idle bot calculations that should improve creep throughput further
    - Fixed a crash when a port switched from initial creep to upgrade mode.
  Known Issues:
    - Space Exploration Compatability: When attempting to place space scaffolding, it will error once per tile, but the creep will progress. (Issue #1)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.2.2
Date: 2024/03/16
  Changes:
    - Fixing bug with available-for-work bot calculations
  Known Issues:
    - Space Exploration Compatability: When attempting to place space scaffolding, it will error once per tile, but the creep will progress. (Issue #1)

Version: 2.2.1
Date: 2024/03/14
  Changes:
    - Fixed slight mis-alignment with area creep. (Reported by: Violet_Scarelli)
    - Partially fixed issues with SE space surfaces, allowing 'asteroid' tiles to be upgraded into space platform.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.2.0
Date: 2024/03/13
  Added:
    - Added a mode that allows you to select tile types based on logistics/construction area. (Suggested by: Violet_Scarelli)
  Changes:
    - Refactored the code to separate the various creep types into their own methods.
    - Partially fixed issues with SE space surfaces, allowing 'asteroid' tiles to be upgraded into space platform.
  Optimizations:
    - Removed redundant / unused code.
  Info:
    - When attempting to place space scaffolding, it will error once per tile, but the creep will progress.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.1
Date: 2024/03/10
  Changes:
    - Added the idle bot logic mentioned in the 2.0.0 changelog. It will now limit bots used for construction based on this setting.
    - Additionally, each active roboport will limit how many ghosts it places, attempting to spread the work around between active roboports.
  Optimizations:
    - Removed redundant / unused code.
    - Improved looping logic to avoid early exits, allowing more processing per iteration.
  Info:
    - There may be minor issues with SE space surfaces, and placing tiles on asteroids. If you know of a way to improve this, I'd love to hear about it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 2.0.0
Date: 2021/12/19

    - Updated required Factorio version to 1.1.49.
    - Starting laying groundwork for a new setting to control how many idle bots the mod is allowed to use. Currently, non-functional.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Added additional checks to ensure roboport tile matching works safely, like if dectorio is removed mid-game.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.3
Date: 2019/09/19

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 2019/08/26
  Fixed:
    - Fixed a crash when adding this mod to a pre-existing save

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2019/08/25
  Added:
    - Concreep performs much better than ever before!
    - Concreep lays down reinforced concrete first, then regular concrete, then seeks out regular concerete to upgrade.
    - Concreep marks cliffs for deconstruction rather than autoremoves them using previous logic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2017/12/28
  Added:
    - Concreep now autoremoves cliffs as concrete is laid down.  Right now it auto-deducts the cliff-explosives from the logistic network instead of delivering it via bot.  Hoping to change this in the future.
  Note:
    - A roboport may fail to remove cliffs if insufficient cliff-explosives are available, and it can be stuck in a state where it won't check again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2017/12/15
  Added:
    - Updated for 0.16
    - Added option to scale back the range roboports will build concrete.
    - Added option to ignore already built tiles (Brick, asphault, etc)

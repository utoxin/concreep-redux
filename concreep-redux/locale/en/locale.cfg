[mod-setting-description]
concreep-range=Range that roboports will automatically place concreep as a percentage of roboport construction range.
concreep-logistics-limit=Change the concreep limit to be based on logistics range, not construction range.
concreep-idle-bot-percentage=What percentage of construction bots must be idle to trigger tile placement.
concreep-minimum-item-count=How many of the items must be available for creeping to happen.
creep-brick=If no concrete is available place bricks if available.
upgrade-brick=Upgrade brick tiles to concrete or reinforced concrete. Turn off if you want to use brick accents for decoration.
upgrade-concrete=Upgrade concrete tiles to reinforced concrete. Turn off if you want to use concrete accents for decoration.
upgrade-space-scaffold=Upgrade space scaffolding to space plating. Has no effect if Space Exploration isn't loaded.
concreep-tiles-per-area=Enable selection of different tile types to use based on whether a given location is in logistic or construction range of a roboport. Note: This disables the normal 'upgrade' logic, and just tries to place the select types. Construction won't overwrite logistic.
